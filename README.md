# Kirby-Like Game (Kaboom.js & TypeScript) - Exploring Game Development
I'm excited to share this Kaboom.js and TypeScript implementation of a Kirby-like game! This project is inspired by the fantastic tutorial on freeCodeCamp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6WvJOiX99s.

Always eager to explore new things, I jumped at the opportunity to develop into game development using Kaboom.js and TypeScript. This project allowed me to experiment with sprite animation, collision detection, and basic game mechanics.

## Features:

### Movement: Control Kirby using the WASD keys:
- W: Jump
- A: Move left
- D: Move right
- S: Absorb enemies (Your modification)
- Enemies: Simple enemy implementation for basic interactions.
- Graphics: Pixel art graphics to capture the classic Kirby style.
